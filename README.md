# Healthcare Data Analysis with Power BI

This project is based on a case study from DataCamp, where I explored hospital efficiency across New York State using Power BI. The focus was on elective hip replacement surgeries, analyzing cost, average length of stay (LOS), and identifying outlier hospitals with unusually high or low performance.

---

##  Project Objective

To evaluate and compare hospital efficiency by:

- Average length of stay per hospital
- Cost per discharge
- Regional and hospital-level trends
- Factors driving inefficiency

---

##  Dataset

- **Source:** SPARCS (New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System)
- **Provided by:** DataCamp
- **Contents:** Hospital discharge data for elective hip replacement procedures

---

##  Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI**: Used to build an interactive dashboard
- **Power Query**: For cleaning and transforming raw data
- **DAX**: To create custom measures like:
  - Average Length of Stay (LOS)
  - Cost per Discharge
- **Visualizations**: Scatter plots, bar charts, KPIs, filters, and more

---

##  Key Findings

- NYC hospitals had higher average LOS and higher costs.
- Hospital size, severity of illness, and mortality risk affected efficiency.
- Some hospitals were identified as high performers based on both cost and LOS.
